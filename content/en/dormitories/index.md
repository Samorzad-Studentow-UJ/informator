## Application and Criteria 

To obtain a place in one of the UJ student residences, complete and register an application in USOSweb --> For All --> Applications. Select the appropriate type of application:  

* **Application for a place in a student residence - higher year students (without CM)** 
* **Application for a place in a student dormitory for 1st year students of MA/MSc studies (without CM)**  
* **Application for a place in a student dormitory for first-year students of BA/BSc and five-year MA/MSc programmes (without CM)**  
* **Application for a place in a student dormitory - only foreign students commencing their studies at UJ (without CM)**  

A place in a student dormitory is granted by the University Economic Committee of the UJ Student Government on the basis of an application registered in USOSweb. There is no need to print out a paper version of the application - in the case of dormitories, registering the application is sufficient. 

 

In the course of processing an application for a place in a Student Dormitory, factors such as:  

* Confirmed severe / moderate / mild disability 
* Activity in the framework of the Student's Government of the Jagiellonian University (scoring depending on the function) 
* Activity within scientific circles/student organizations (scored depending on the function performed) 
* Full orphan status before the age of 26. 
* Receiving a social grant 
* Receiving rector's scholarship or minister's scholarship 
* Distance from the place of residence 
* Declared net income per family member for the month preceding the application submission (only for first-year students beginning their studies) 
* All factors indicated by the student must be properly confirmed by an appropriate document (in the case of distance, it may be a screenshot from Google Maps). 

  

The next step is the selection and ranking of the dormitories in which the student wishes to live. If one of the dormitories is not added to the shopping cart, it will be omitted from the application. Therefore, if the student does not get into any of the dorms they have indicated, none will be assigned. 

  

You may also indicate the person(s) with whom you wish to live (however, please note that all persons will be assigned to the dorm assigned to the person with the lowest number of points). All persons must name the same students and have the same dormitories ranked in the same order. 

  

If you are applying for a place in a student residence with a spouse, child, or guardian of a disabled person, you must provide a spousal or guardian consent statement before registering your application. A scan of the signed statement should be sent to: [stypendia@uj.edu.pl](mailto:stypendia@uj.edu.pl),
