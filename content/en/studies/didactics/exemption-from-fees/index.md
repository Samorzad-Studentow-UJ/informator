3. the repetition of specific courses in full-time programmes due to 

3. repetition of specific courses in full-time programmes due to unsatisfactory academic performance; 

1. taking courses not included in the curriculum. 

 

According to § 11 para. 2, a student may apply for an exemption in particularly justified cases. Such cases include, in particular,: 

1. when, for fortuitous reasons, a student has found himself or herself.

in an extremely difficult financial situation; 

1. obtaining outstanding results in the studies; (condition: average score for the previous year of studies at least 4.75);

2. participation in international exchange programmes. 

 The above set is an open catalogue, which means that the student is not limited only by these three cases, but may also submit an application in any other special circumstances that he/she deems justified to be the basis for fee exemption.  

 Depending on the basis for the exemption, the student is obliged to attach to the application a set of documents confirming the circumstances justifying the granting of the exemption, in particular: 

1. a set of documentation necessary to determine the income per family member, confirming the material situation, in accordance with the requirements for applying for a maintenance grant set out in separate regulations; 

2. documents confirming the existence of fortuitous reasons; 

3. opinion of the unit in the social welfare system responsible for determining the income and financial situation of people and their families; 

4. other documents that confirm the circumstances indicated in the application. 

The application for fee exemption must be submitted by 20 September of the year preceding the academic year to which the fee applies. The application may be submitted after the deadline referred to in Section 1 if the reason justifying the exemption or the obligation to pay the fee arises during the academic year. In this case, the request should be submitted within 14 days of the reason or obligation to pay the fee arising, but not later than the end of May of the academic year in question. This is the case for, e.g. fees for repeated courses, as the reason justifying the obligation to pay (calculation of a certain amount) occurs at the moment when the student receives information about such an obligation (in practice: it appears in the USOSweb system in the appropriate tab related to payments). 

The letter should be addressed to the dean of a particular faculty. There is no official template for this application. Some departments have their own templates on their websites. The following is the specimen provided by the UJ Student Government: 

If the application is not granted or is granted only in part, the student has the right to request reconsideration, which should be submitted to the Vice-Rector for Teaching within 14 days from the date of delivery of the Dean's decision. 

The student may also request that the payment be divided into instalments or that the repayment deadline be extended according to the rules described above.
