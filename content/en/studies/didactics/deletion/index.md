Being thrown off the student register is tantamount to a person being deprived of their student status. There are two groups of reasons that lead to such a decision being taken by the relevant dean.

Obligatory reasons (if they occur, the dean is obliged to issue a decision to strike a student from the register of students)

1. failure to conduct studies,

2. Written resignation from the course of study.

3. failure to submit the diploma dissertation or the diploma examination by the deadline,

4. being punished with the disciplinary penalty of expulsion from the university.

Optional reasons (if they are met, the dean may decide to strike a student from the register of students):

1. a statement of lack of participation in compulsory classes,

2. lack of progress in education

3. failure to complete a year of studies within the specified time limit,

4. failure to pay fees related to the study course, despite a written request to do so within seven days after its delivery.

It is worth remembering that the dean's decision to strike a student from the register of students may be appealed for reconsideration of the matter to the rector within 14 days of the delivery of the decision.

IMPORTANT!!! Recall that the Rector's decision on expulsion from the list of students may be appealed against to the administrative court.
