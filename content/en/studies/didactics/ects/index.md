ECTS credits, or the "European Credit Transfer System", are the rules developed by the European Commission to standardize studying at European universities. With these points, the requirements for each course are determined in order to be able to calculate the academic year. Points are closely related to the number of hours a student spends studying. The Commission has calculated that a full-time student spends around 1500 hours studying in one year, so 1 ECTS is around 25 hours, so the annual workload should be 60 ECTS credits.

### When and how can we transfer ECTS credits?

It is possible to rewrite grades and ECTS credits for courses and credits taken at other universities or faculties.

The dean, at the student's request, may allow the transfer and recognition of ECTS credits within five years of the completion of the course (in exceptional cases it is possible after this period).

The basis for the course transcription is the submission of an application together with the original documentation constituting the basis for the transcription, which states the convergence of the educational results obtained.

We can compare it by checking the syllabuses of given courses.

The student receives the number of ECTS credits assigned to the course to which the credits are transferred.

Credits can be transferred within the framework of exchange programmes. This is done on the basis of an agreement between the University and the partner institution (e.g. Erasmus programme).

If there is a credit for English language courses or the student wants to present a certificate obtained, such a decision is considered by the Rector.
