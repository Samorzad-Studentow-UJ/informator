This is a form of verification of students' achievement of learning outcomes, that is, knowledge, skills, and social competences.

#### What exams can you take while studying?

1. A 'zero' exam

This is an exam that takes place earlier than an examination session. Taking it is optional and is a kind of "recognition" for the student. Such an exam does not have the consequence of losing one of the terms in case of failure. In practice, this means that even if a student receives a negative mark, he/she may take the first and the resit examination.

2 Early examination

It differs from a zero exam. The student may also take it earlier, that is, before the examination session. The difference lies in the fact that if a student receives a negative mark, then the next term is an exam in a resit session (i.e. the so-called second term, no exam on the proper term).

3 Re-sit examination

This is the student's second examination term, to be used if the student does not receive a positive mark on the first term. The student is always entitled to a resit.

4. Examination within the framework of repeating a subject.

This is an examination that a student should take if they fail to pass a resit examination. The student should apply to the Dean for a conditional repeat of the subject. Then the student has the possibility to continue studies in a higher year and semester, but this involves paying for the subject, as well as taking and passing the subject in the following year. This right is granted only from the second semester onward. The student must submit the application before the beginning of the academic year.

5 Board Examination

Taken when an examination has not been conducted in accordance with the established rules and the student has been prevented from taking it in appropriate conditions. This examination is conducted within 2 to 14 days of being ordered. A student appears before an examination board. A note is made of each board examination.

#### Examination dates

Examination dates are set by the course coordinator in consultation with the Dean. Information on the dates of examinations and final course tests must be made available to students no later than two months before the first date set.

As a rule, one examination date should be set in the main session and one in the resit session.

If a student receives a failing grade from the first deadline, they have the right to take a resit examination. However, we must remember that if the re-sit date for a given student is the first attempt to take an examination, he/she loses the right to another date.

It is possible that the teacher will order the drawing of the registration lists for the examination dates. Such lists are closed no earlier than 4 days before the examination.

Once a list has been closed, you may not add or remove students from it without the permission of the teacher.

#### What if I do not pass the course?

It is also possible that a student does not obtain a pass in a subject, which means that he/she is not allowed to take an exam.

Such students are entitled to one re-sit before the start of the re-sit session if the teaching and assessment methods allow for this.

#### Justified or unjustified failure to take an examination?

In the case of an unjustified failure to take an examination on the first date, a student may take this examination, but only as a resit (losing one of the dates).

In the case of a justified failure to take an examination (e.g. due to illness), students have the right to submit a request to justify the absence from the examination within 7 days of the examination date. The dean then considers such a request and, together with the teacher responsible for the course, sets an additional examination date no later than the end of the academic year; this also applies to resit examinations. Reinstating an additional examination date is not allowed.

#### Examination results

The course tutor is required to publish the results on the USOSweb system within 10 days of the examination date or credit date, no later than by the end of the given academic year.
