In justified cases, the dean may grant permission to set a third examination date for a given course within the same academic year. A petition to this effect must be submitted before the end of the academic year. 

This also applies to the final course credit if the study methods and the verification methods make this possible. 

In the case of sequential courses, the completion of which determines participation in the courses of the following semester, the deadline for applying is 5 days from the date of the announcement of the grade for the second semester.
