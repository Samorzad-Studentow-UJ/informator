The academic year clearance consists of verifying whether the student has completed all required and declared courses in the academic year. The completion of the year is confirmed by entry into the next study year.

At Jagiellonian University, the credit unit within the course of study is the year of study. This means that each student is required to complete a year of study by the end of the academic year at the latest, i.e. by September 30 of a given year.

The year should be completed in the USOSweb system. After logging in, click on the "FOR STUDENTS" tab and then the "PAYMENTS" tab. The next step is to click on the "submit programme for clearing" icon. Once you have done this, all you have to do is wait for the dean's office to clear your year.

ATTENTION!!.. Remember that the year must be settled after all grades and credits have been entered into the USOSweb system. However, this must be done by 30 September of the given year.
