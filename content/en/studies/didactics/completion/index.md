## Conducting the diploma examination

In order for a student to be admitted to the diploma examination, it is necessary: 

\- Fulfilment of all requirements specified in the study programme;

\- Checking of the written diploma paper with the use of the Single Anti-Plagiarism System;

\- Obtaining a positive grade for the diploma paper;

\- Submission of all required documents to the office of the unit responsible for the course of study;

The examination should take place within a maximum of one month of the date on which all conditions for taking it have been met; the dean may extend this deadline by one month, but only for justified reasons.

The diploma examination may be oral or written;

At the end of the diploma examination, a grade is given for the diploma examination based on the grading scale adopted in the Rules and Regulations for Studies, which is used, among other things, for grading examinations during the session.

### Second date

Obtaining an unsatisfactory grade or an unexcused non-attendance at the examination - in this case the dean (in the latter case accepting as justified the non-attendance of the examination) designates a second examination date, upon a written application submitted by the student within seven days of the designated examination date, but this examination may not take place later than three months after the date of the first examination.

Attention: It is not permissible to restore the second examination date.

### Third date

Failure to pass the diploma examination on two dates - then the dean may designate a third date for the diploma examination if he/she deems this justified. The third date for the diploma examination is designated no earlier than one month and no later than two months after the date of the second date for the diploma examination.

Obtaining an unsatisfactory grade from the third date of the diploma examination or not taking the examination without justification means that the student is crossed out of the register of students and cannot take up studies again.

Examination by board - a request for an examination by board should be submitted by the student or student government to the dean if:

1. the examination has been conducted in an irregular manner, or

2. the scope of the examination exceeded the form and conditions laid down for the diploma examination. 

and conditions laid down for the diploma examination.

The examination is conducted within a period of 2 to 14 days following the date on which it is ordered, after consultation with the student concerned.

The form and date of an examination by an examination board shall be established by the Dean in consultation with the chairperson of the board. The result of the examination commission is taken into account as the basis for passing the diploma examination, even if it was conducted after the deadline for passing the year.

It is worth knowing that, at the student's request, an observer appointed by the student may take part in the examination by the board.
