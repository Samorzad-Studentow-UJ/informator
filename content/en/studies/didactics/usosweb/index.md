USOSweb is a platform for students and academics that is essential for everyday student life. What possibilities does it offer?

1. Logging into USOSweb

There are two ways to log in to the USOSweb system:

* using as an identifier an e-mail address in the domain '@uj.edu.pl' or '@student.uj.edu.pl', @doctoral.uj.edu.pl, @alumni.uj.edu.pl, which must be activated.
* using a log-in of the form 'identyfikator@usosweb.uj.edu.pl' during the first login before activating the email address in the @uj.edu.pl domain:
* pesel (1234567890@usosweb.uj.edu.pl)
* index (12345@usosweb.uj.edu.pl)
* name abbreviation given by the secretariat (a.nowak@usosweb.uj.edu.pl);

Activation of an account in the domain uj.edu.pl

It is the responsibility of each student to have an active account in the domain student.uj.edu.pl. The associated email address is used to send all decisions, notifications, requests, and communications related to studying and the organisation of classes. It gives you access to your own mailbox in Office 365 (Microsoft Outlook) and opens up many other possibilities. How do I activate it?

Go to and log in to the main website https://login.uj.edu.pl/login Go to 'FOR STUDENTS'.

In the menu on the left, click “Email Activation”.

Follow the instructions and activate your email. The activation process may take a while. After activation, your university mail details will be used to log into the USOSweb system.

1. Mobile applications

USOSweb and university mail Outlook can be used with mobile applications, making it easy to stay up to date with all incoming information. Simply download the "Microsoft Outlook" and "Mobile USOS UJ" applications and log in with your account data in the student.uj.edu.pl domain. You will be kept up to date with the news from your lecturers and administration, you will receive information about processed applications or latest grades, you will be able to view statistics, and much more. 1. Microsoft Outlook mail

An account in the domain student.uj.edu.pl gives you access to your own mailbox in Office 365 (Microsoft Outlook). The UJ Mail address is the Microsoft email address you have had since activation and can be used through the Microsoft Outlook application or website. You can thereby log in to accompanying Microsoft services such as OneDrive, MS Forms, and MS Teams.

1. Registration for courses

Students are required to self-register for all subjects they wish to take for credit during the academic year, including compulsory subjects. Registration takes place exclusively through USOSweb. How do I enter it?

Go to the main website https://www.usosweb.uj.edu.pl/ and log in.

Go to the 'FOR STUDENTS' tab. Click on 'REGISTRATION'.

A list of registrations will open.

NOTE: The list of registrations can also be accessed through the "REGISTRATION CALENDAR" on the USOSweb home page by selecting the appropriate organizational unit. Sometimes, before the lists of individual registrations are in the "REGISTRATION" tab, we can already find them this way. This allows us to view the subjects in advance. An inventory of all registrations can also be found under "FOR ALL" " STATISTICS" " REGISTRATION STATISTICS".

How do I register for a course?

As a rule, during the registration process, you just need to click on the basket with the word "REGISTER" next to the name of the subject or on its page.

In the case of exercises, select a class (a page with a selection table will open and you will need to select the class you want) and then click on the registration button. You can view the table by clicking on the second icon on the right.

IMPORTANT: When you refresh the table of activity groups page, the first group will be selected by default. If it is not your choice, you should change it before clicking "REGISTER".

TIP: It is a good idea to find out which subjects or groups are busy, as you may need to register the second it starts.

How do I register for an exam?

Go to the "FOR STUDENTS" tab.

Click on "REGISTRATION".

A list of registrations opens and you select "Register for exams". Click "Register" next to the term you are interested in. Then find the group you are interested in and click on the grey button below the row with information about the start time and the status of the group.

How do I register for PE / Lectures / Lectures in Artes Liberales?

On the main USOSweb page in the menu "IN SHORTCuts" on the left, there are tabs "Registration for P.E." (without Collegium Medicum) and "Registration for Lectures". You can also access them by clicking "FOR STUDENTS" and in the grey menu bar on the left "TOKEN REGISTRATIONS". These are token registrations, which means that you can only register when "active registration" is displayed (this is indicated by the text above the blue progress bar). During this time, notifications are collected in registering/unregistering from groups. During the "registration break", the system allocates places (registers/deregisters according to requests) in appropriate groups.

Select the appropriate registration.

Click on the appropriate subject name for which you wish to register (sometimes it may be useful to filter subjects).

When the group list appears, click on the icon. 

Null to register for classes in the appropriate group.
