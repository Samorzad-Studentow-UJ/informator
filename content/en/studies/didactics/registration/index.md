By registering for subjects, a student can participate in specific subjects and thus follow their study programme. The registration takes place in the USOSweb system. Information about planned registrations is displayed after logging in to the USOSweb system, and is also available under "REGISTRATION CALENDAR". Sometimes students are also informed by email about the specific subjects they should register for. Several types of registration are possible in the USOSweb system:

### Token registration

Usually applies to lectures, physical education, and general university subjects. In the new token registration model, as opposed to the old model, the result of registration to a group does not depend on the order of users' applications, i.e. the first-come, first-served principle does not apply. The registration procedure is as follows: during short microtours, the user sends in his/her requests, and during the interval between them, he/she learns about the result of the processing of all user requests. If the microtour ends, a pause begins (During which an algorithm is run that scatters places in groups. As soon as it finishes its operation, it displays the results of the registration to all users), and after that, the next microtour starts. The user may have to participate in several microtours before they can register.

### Two-stage registration

Firstly, registration for individual subjects takes place, then students submit their preferences for activity groups and the system allocates them to groups according to their submitted preferences, or they select groups themselves in the next round of registration.

### Direct registration

Students register immediately for the subject and exercise groups (they choose specific groups and see immediately whether they have been registered).

You can also find instructions for each type of registration on the USOSweb system. It is possible to register both for subjects included in the study plan and those not, e.g., as part of an Individual Study Plan. However, the study programme may require you to register for individual subjects. Under "FOR STUDENTS"  "REGISTRATION  "REGISTRATIONS" should show the registrations that you currently have access to. Sometimes, registrations for another course or year are also displayed there. If this is the case, please look closely for the registration dedicated to your course and year. In this tab, you can also check the status of your registration and whether it is active.

## What is a subject?

A subject can take the form of a lecture, laboratory, exercise, conversation class, seminar, proseminar, or practical placement. The study program specifies in what form the subject will be realized. Furthermore, each course corresponds to a certain number of ECTS credits. The total number of credits from all courses taken in an academic year must be at least 60, but does not have to be distributed evenly between the two semesters.

A course may comprise more than one form of learning, e.g. lecture + classes. Some subjects may be taught sequentially, e.g. in the first and second semesters of an academic year. In such a case, passing this particular course in the first semester is necessary to pass the course in the summer semester. (If in the first semester you took Chemistry I, and in the second semester you took Chemistry II, you cannot take Chemistry II without passing Chemistry I, and you cannot get a credit for it).

Most courses require students to register for specific courses through the USOS system. Sometimes, however, a student is automatically registered for all or part of a course by the Registrar's Office. Both in the first and in the second case each subject has to be linked to a stage. These steps are necessary in order to submit the subject declaration, which, if not submitted in time, may result in the student being struck from the list of students or not being able to take examinations in the subject which was not included in the declaration.

## Links

Hooking up is the assignment of a course to which a student has been registered (either through registration or the Registrar's Office) to the programme of study followed by the student and within which the course is to be charged. The link is made after the student has registered for all courses. This is necessary for the USOSweb system to generate the subject declaration. After logging in to the USOS system, the link is made in the tab: "FOR STUDENTS"  "Subjects" in the specified time. All subjects should be subscribed; however, due to their nature the following division is made:

\- Subjects included in the study plan should be subsumed under the programme and the corresponding stage of study. Subjects included in the study plan should be linked to the curriculum and the corresponding study stage. Linking to the stage can be completed later, if at the time of registration for the subject the corresponding stage of studies does not yet exist for the student, in particular for subjects undergoing advancement, courses conducted at the Jagiellonian University Pedagogical Centre, or subjects in the registration for the next academic year, started before the settlement of the previous year.

\- Subjects not included in the study plan, in particular courses realised within the framework of free tokens at the Jagiellonian Language Centre. They will not be taken into account in the process of accounting for the studies, included in the grade point average, or shown on the declarations, unless the dean of the faculty decides otherwise at the student's request; in this case, the secretary's office staff may modify the subset.



## Subject declarations

They can be submitted electronically by the specified deadline via the USOSweb system twice an academic year - in winter and summer semesters. Failure to submit the declaration by the due date may result in expulsion from the list of students or inability to take an exam in the subject not included in the subject declaration. In the "declaration" tab, you should make sure that your declaration includes all the subjects scheduled for a given semester and that the sum of ECTS credits is correct - summing up the subjects from winter and summer semesters should include at least 60 ECTS credits, but they do not have to be distributed evenly over the two semesters.
