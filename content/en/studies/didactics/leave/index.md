A student may take leave from classes in the following ways:

## Student leave

It may be taken from the second year of study by submitting an appropriate application to the dean, indicating the period for which it is to be taken. This leave may not last longer than two semesters. If you apply during a semester, student leave is granted for the following semester.

## Dean's leave

It may be taken by submitting an appropriate application to the dean due to important circumstances which make it impossible for a student to participate in classes, in particular due to health condition, disability or related to giving birth and raising a child. A student may be granted dean's leave twice within a given course of study, for a maximum of four semesters. A student may apply for Dean's leave immediately after the reason for it has arisen. Dean's leave cannot be granted for a previous period or during an examination session, unless the reason justifying the leave has arisen earlier. If Dean's leave is granted for health reasons, the condition for taking up studies after returning from leave is to present the dean with a medical certificate stating that there are no contraindications to continuing studies.

## Notes

→ leave from classes is granted on a semester basis.

→ If the leave ends during a semester, it is extended until the end of that semester.

→  failure of a student to report to commencement of studies after returning from a leave of absence before the end of the course

The beginning of classes in each semester constitutes grounds for declaring a failure to take up

Studies.

→ in particularly justified cases, during the period of leave of absence, the student may, with the approval of the Dean and under the conditions laid down by him/her, attend classes and pass courses. If leave is granted for health reasons or for reasons of pregnancy, the condition for granting such permission is that the student presents the dean with a doctor's certificate stating that there are no contraindications to taking classes and passing examinations or courses of study.

→ leave for a pregnant student is granted for the period up to the day of birth of the child, and leave for a student who is a parent is granted for up to 1 year.

→ a pregnant student and a student parent cannot be refused a dean's leave, even if the full amount of the leave has been taken.

→ the student parent applies for leave within 1 year of the birth of the child.
