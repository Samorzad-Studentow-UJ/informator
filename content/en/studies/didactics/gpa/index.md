How to calculate your grade-point average?

The average of grade points for a given academic year or the entire course of study is calculated as a weighted average, with weights determined by the values of appropriate ECTS credits from all grades obtained in that period, including failing grades.

The grade average is calculated as follows:

avg = (O1 ∗ w1 + ... + On ∗ wn) : (w1 + ... + wn)

where the components are

avg - average grade calculated to two decimal places;

Oi - grade for subject i to be taken into account

Wi - the weight assigned to subject i, expressed in the number of ECTS points.

\* If a student takes an examination more than once, the average grade is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the grades obtained on all dates, including failing grades, rounded to two decimal places.
