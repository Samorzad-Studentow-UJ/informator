title: Repeating a year
order: 7
stub: false

In the case of:

1. Obtaining a lower number of ECTS credits than required for conditional entry.

or

2. failure to compensate for the difference in points in connection with obtaining conditional entry for the next year of study. 

or 

3. failure to meet other requirements for completing a given year of study resulting from the curriculum.

It is possible to apply to repeat a year of study. Please note that it is not possible to repeat a year if you have not passed the first year of study.

To be allowed to repeat a year, a student must apply for permission to repeat a year before the academic year begins. When repeating a year, a student has the right to attend classes and take examinations scheduled for the following year, unless this is not precluded by the sequential system of classes, examinations, or another condition laid down in the study programme.

Repeating a year is not allowed if the first year of study has not been completed. Repeating a subject within the same year of study is not allowed before the end of the credit period of the first year of study. There is an exception to this rule. In justified cases, the dean may give permission to repeat the same or another year of study once within the course of study.
