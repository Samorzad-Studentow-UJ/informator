The individual organisation of studies may consist of the application of an individual study programme or an individual study plan. In both cases, the student applies for one of these options to the dean for student affairs of his/her faculty.

#### Individual Study Program

The student may use the Individual Study Program when he/she has a specific academic interest or wants to conduct research on a specific topic. If there are subjects in the study programme for his/her field of study which he/she does not wish to pursue (he/she is not interested in their subject matter), the student may adapt the plan to his/her interests and enrol in corresponding subjects assigned to another field of study.

In the application for an Individual Study Programme, the student should present a proposal for a revised study programme, i.e. indicate the subjects he/she does not wish to take and those he/she wishes to take instead. The student's modified programme of studies should be approved by a supervisor selected by the student, an academic teacher who holds at least a doctoral degree.

#### Individual Study Plan

The possibility of using an Individual Study Plan is intended for students who cannot follow the plan of their course of study specified in the syllabus for reasons such as: disability, illness, studying more than one course, taking care of a child, participating in exchange programmes or being active in the student government or a student organisation for the University.

Within the Individual Study Plan, the student may specify individual conditions for attending classes, completing courses, and passing examinations. In the application for an Individual Study Plan, the student should indicate what the modification of the study plan is to consist of and present the individual conditions for the completion of the courses, as previously agreed with the teachers of individual courses and confirmed by their signatures. The student must also provide reasons for his request.
