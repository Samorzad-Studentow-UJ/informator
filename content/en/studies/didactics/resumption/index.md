After being struck off the list of students, it is possible to be readmitted to a given course of study (resumption of studies):

\- an application for readmission to a given course of study is submitted to the dean of the relevant course. If the application is accepted, the student is readmitted to the course of study at the beginning of the next academic year;

NOTE!!! The dean cannot grant permission to resume a course of study in a given field of study if the student is removed from the student register as a result of a disciplinary penalty of expulsion from the university.

\- If the interruption connected with expulsion from the list of students exceeds 5 years, reentry into the course of study takes place according to the recruitment rules for the first year of study, unless the dean decides otherwise;

\- if the student has been struck from the register of students during the first year of study, it is not possible to apply for readmission under the above application procedure. It is necessary to go through the admission process again;

\- ECTS credits gained previously in the renewed course of study will be rewritten, but the number of credits may be reduced if the course programme has been changed; in extreme cases, the student may be refused credit for the course. The differences must be made up by the student;

\- the resumption of studies is considered as a continuation of the previous course of studies;

\- The resumption of studies within the same field of study is possible only once. If a particular course of study is no longer offered, it is not possible to resume a course of study;

\- if the student was struck from the register of students before the current Academic Regulations came into force and the student begins his/her course of study in another field of study, the dean of the other field of study may accept an application for study to be resumed if the learning outcomes coincide, taking into account curriculum differences;

\- if the third attempt to pass the diploma examination is unsuccessful, it is not possible to resume study in the given field of study.
