Requests concerning matters related to your course of study and examinations (e.g. conditional entry, excuse for an examination) can be addressed to the vice-dean responsible for student affairs in the faculty or another authorised person as indicated on the faculty or institute website. You should submit your request through the appropriate dean's office/secretariat for your course of study. Remember that you can submit your application electronically by sending it by email at the domain uj.edu.pl. 

Detailed information on the procedures at each faculty can be found on the Faculty or Departmental Student Government Council websites. 

Remember that in the case of leaves of absence from classes, transfer from another university, removal from the list of students, and resumption of studies, the only person competent to take a decision is the vice-dean. 

You may submit an appeal (objection) against the decision to the Vice-Rector for Education within 14 days after receiving it, via the Didactics Support Centre. 

If you have any concerns or problems, please contact the Student Rights Team.
