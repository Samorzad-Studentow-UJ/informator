#### Microsoft Teams

A cloud-based web service available as part of Microsoft Office 365 that contains a set of tools and services for team collaboration. It allows users to connect in real time via pre-created "teams", i.e. groups of classes created in advance by the class leader. The person in charge of the class can, among other things, share his or her desktop to give a presentation or attach a file containing materials necessary for the proper conduct of exercises. The application has a number of useful features which have made it a basic tool for remote work at Jagiellonian University. Students log in using the same data as in the USOSweb system. It is recommended to download the program to your device, because then the service works more stable.

#### Pegaz platform

The Jagiellonian University's e-learning platform connected with USOSweb plays an important role in many students' lives. It is here that in most cases instructors make available recorded lectures, longer scientific articles, or materials strictly related to exams. In the first year of studies, it is necessary to pass a health and safety course conducted through the PEGAZ platform.

#### Extranet UJ

The website through which we gain access to the interactive collections of the Jagiellonian Library. Both academic journals and books are available to students. The portal also offers the possibility to view websites which are available only after connecting to the Jagiellonian University Wi-Fi network, e.g. Legalis. The data to be entered when logging into the site are identical to those in the USOSweb system.

#### Outlook

University email is the main tool for direct contact with course instructors. It is to this address that all messages regarding the Jagiellonian University and the course of study will be delivered by default. The student email account is named name.surname@student.uj.edu.pl and the password, which can be changed later, is the PESEL number.
