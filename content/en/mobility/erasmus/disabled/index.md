 Students with disabilities applying for the project are subject to the same recruitment rules as other students.  

 Those qualified for the Erasmus programme can apply for funding from a fund intended for disabled students. The additional grants are intended to cover exceptional costs related to the specific needs of people with disabilities.  

 For people with a recognised mild or moderate disability, the National Agency may award an additional grant in the form of a top-up to the maximum amount specified for travel to the country concerned for the planned duration of stay. For severely disabled people, the National Agency may also grant an additional amount for a specific purpose. Decisions on grants for disabled grant holders are taken on an individual basis.  

 A student applying for a grant should fill in a relevant application form, which needs to be signed by the university Erasmus coordinator (at DOSZ) and the university disability officer (at DON).  

 Detailed information concerning trips within the Erasmus programme can be obtained from the Department for International Student Exchange ([DOSZ](https://internationalstudents.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/)).
