*  the purpose of the placement;  
*  level of knowledge of the foreign language in which the Erasmus+ placement will take place

Additional criteria that may be applied if more than one candidate obtains the same weighted average of the basic criteria are:  

* weighted mean score for the previous period of study;  
* the result of an interview.  

 

**What is the eligibility procedure for an Erasmus+ placement?**   

 DOSZ checks whether the candidates fulfil the formal criteria. After fulfilling the formal conditions, the applications will be evaluated according to the above mentioned eligibility criteria on the basis of the submitted documents.  

  

The recruitment process will be summarised in ranking lists.  

 In the case of the same number of ranking points, the weighted average grade for the previous study period or an interview will be decisive for granting the Erasmus+ grant.  

 The Erasmus+ scholarship will be awarded to candidates who:  

*  Obtain a weighted average not less than 2.00; 
* And will be ranked first in the ranking lists.  

  

In order to receive the funding, you will be required to sign a contract and submit all the documents required by DOSZ within the deadlines listed on the DOSZ website.  

  

**What documents do I need to sign before going on an Erasmus+ placement?**  

 Before leaving for an Erasmus+ placement, the student signs the following documents:  

 "Learning Agreement for Traineeship". (The Learning Agreement for Traineeships, which is an agreement between the student, the host institution and the Jagiellonian University specifying the programme and the course of the placement.  

 The "Placement Contract" between the student and the Jagiellonian University, which specifies in detail the conditions of the placement and the payment and settlement of the grant;  

 Moreover, the student is obliged to take a language test before starting the placement (OLS).  

  

**What other formalities await the student before going on Erasmus placement?**  

 Each Erasmus+ grant receiver is obliged to take out an accident insurance, a workplace or personal liability insurance and to obtain a suitable health insurance before departure.  

 Basic health insurance is guaranteed by the European Health Insurance Card issued by the NFZ. The card is only valid in EU countries and covers only part of the benefits associated with treatment. Detailed information is available on the NFZ website. If you go to e.g. Turkey, you should take out an insurance policy with an insurance company.  

  

**What formalities await the student after returning from the Erasmus+ placement?**  

 On return from the host institution the student is obliged to: 

* provide a confirmation of the placement issued by the host institution, including the actual start and end date of the placement and the assessment of the placement, found on the last pages of the Learning Agreement for Traineeships ('section to be completed after mobility')  
* complete the post placement language test (OLS)  
* complete the Erasmus+ online grantee questionnaire  

  

**Does the host institution provide accommodation?**  

It can provide, but is not obliged to. There is no obligation under Erasmus+ rules for the placement provider to provide accommodation for the student, but the provider should at least provide information on how to find accommodation.  

  

**Will the placement abroad be credited by Jagiellonian University?**  

 Yes, this is a requirement of the Erasmus+ programme. The credit for an Erasmus+ placement as a compulsory placement, which is an integral part of studies at the Jagiellonian University, is granted upon prior agreement with the coordinator of compulsory placements at the home institution. In the case of an optional placement, care should be taken to include it in the Diploma Supplement as an additional student achievement.
