**NAWA Programmes**

NAWA works for the internationalization of Polish science by supporting and stimulating international research cooperation and academic exchange. The Agency strives to strengthen scientific excellence, internationalization of Polish universities and scientific institutions and promotion of Poland - its language and culture in order to build an image of a country offering interesting educational and research opportunities. These objectives are realised through the Agency's broad programme offer.  

  

   

  

**STUDENTS**    

  

One of the basic tasks of NAWA is to initiate and support student mobility. This task will be carried out through programmes aimed at increasing the level of internationalisation of Polish higher education institutions and enabling Polish students to gain international experience.   

  

 

**What programmes for students?**   

  

NAWA offers both outgoing and incoming programmes.   

   

  

**What do they fund?**   

Funds from NAWA are provided in the form of scholarships dedicated to foreign students studying in Poland or Polish students doing partial studies and study stays abroad. The amount of monthly scholarship will vary depending on the programme and degree of studies.   

  

Programmes for students - scholarships, academic exchanges   

  

International experience gained at university is a lifelong capital - professional, academic and social. Therefore, NAWA wishes to enhance mobility through scholarship programmes for foreign and Polish students. At present, academic exchanges are possible within the framework of the CEEPUS programme, as well as bilateral cooperation (bilateral agreements) between Poland and other countries. NAWA's proposals also include scholarships for students from abroad, thanks to which the beneficiary may better acclimatise to the country.   

  

* CEEPUS - Central European University Exchange Programme   

  

The main objective of the CEEPUS Agreement ("Central European Exchange Program for University Studies") is to support academic exchange in the field of education and professional development of students and university teachers. It enables intensification of contacts between higher education institutions in the Contracting Parties to the Agreement by financing academic mobility.
