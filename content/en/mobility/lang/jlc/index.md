The Jagiellonian Language Center (JCJ) is an inter-faculty unit of the Jagiellonian University, which deals with language training for students of the Jagiellonian University and academic staff, and also conducts commercial language courses and training for budgetary sector employees, which are financed from the structural funds of the European Union. The programs are implemented according to CEFR standards and apply to all language courses conducted at JCJ, both at the lowest level A1 and the highest C2, according to CEFR. JCJ honors international language certificates that allow you to complete a course in a given language and start learning a new foreign language. The Jagiellonian Language Center conducts academic courses in eight modern languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian, Italian) as well as Latin and Greek. C.a. 10,000 people attend those classes. Learning a foreign language at the 1st and 2nd cycle studies is compulsory, however recently, for 1st-year MA/MSc students, it is possible to start a free course of another foreign language. The certificate obtained after taking a foreign language course at JCJ confirms your competences, among others for the purposes of recruitment for professional work or recruitment to an international exchange program.
