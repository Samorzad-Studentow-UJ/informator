„Intro Days” is a series of meetings, in which the main purpose is to introduce international students starting their studies at the Jagiellonian University (except for participants of exchange programs). This event is organized by Foreign Students Service Department UJ. We wish that your participation in them will help you familiarize yourself with the new realities of studies and everyday life in a new city. The program includes meetings with representatives of the academic community as well as workshops that are conducted not only by organizations connected with the university but also by non-university institutions.
