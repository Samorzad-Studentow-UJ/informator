An alliance formed by nine leading European research universities form the basis of the [Una Europa](https://www.una-europa.eu/about/o-nas-w-jezyku-polskim) university union. The Una Europa alliance comprises: Freie Universität Berlin, Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna, University of Edinburgh, Helsingin yliopisto/ Helsingfors universitet, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, KU Leuven, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, Universiteit Leiden. The history of educating citizens in the associated universities dates back more than 1000 years and the current total number of students in all universities exceeds 400,000. The academic community of Una Europa reaches half a million and the number of remote learners has several million participants. The Alliance aims to create the university of the future - a truly European inter-university environment, built on the potential and strengths of its partners. At the moment, it is possible to take a [Bachelor's degree in European Studies](https://www.una-europa.eu/initiatives/joint-european-bachelor) as part of the university's collaboration, whereby the awarding of the final degree involves it being honoured by all partner universities. Another study programme offered by Una Europa is the [Joint Doctorate in Cultural Heritage](https://www.una-europa.eu/initiatives/joint-doctorate-in-cultural-heritage). In addition to the study programmes, the alliance also offers other [initiatives](https://www.una-europa.eu/initiatives). These include a research team, the so-called "think-tank" - [Future UniLab](https://www.una-europa.eu/initiatives/future-unilab-1), whose role is to create a space to discuss a vision of how the university of the future should operate, as well as to create groundbreaking tools to implement modern education. Una Europa is also about training programmes during the holiday season - [Una.Futura](https://www.una-europa.eu/initiatives/una-futura), but also about smaller events that will contribute to the development of e-learning as well as the improvement of traditional education methods. Cultural and social diversity is a benefit that will make it easier to adapt the functioning of the alliance, as well as improve the transfer of what is most valuable - experiences beyond national borders. A programme aimed at sharing cultural experiences, social differences and also the way things work is the seven-week online course - [Una.Together](https://www.una-europa.eu/initiatives/una-together). It also aims to engage the international student community in academic and social networking that will broaden the perspectives and concepts of international integration. Additionally, as part of the alliance's work, an initiative is envisaged to be carried out periodically on the premises of the partner universities - the Student Congress, the honour of which for the year 2022 fell to the Jagiellonian University. Most importantly, what you have learnt after reading this description is not all, because Una Europa is aimed at the development as suggested by the entire academic community, including students, so don't wait and start changing the academic reality around you by [joining the ranks of students from all over Europe](https://www.una-europa.eu/get-involved)!
