Erasmus Student Network UJ Cracow is a part of one of the biggest non-profit student associations in Europe. ESN focuses on helping students participating in the Erasmus + exchange program. Each year ESN organizes Orientation Week for all incoming students, during which you can learn about life in Poland, meet new people, take part in integration events, travel and much more. The organization also distributes ESNcards, which entitle students to use discounts from ESN partners throughout Europe (e.g. Ryanair, Logitech, Hostelling International).
