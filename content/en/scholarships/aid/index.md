title: Aid
stub: false
---
It is a one-time benefit that can be received by a student who is in a temporary difficult life situation that significantly affects their financial situation and/or studies, e.g. 

* Disease 
* Childbirth 
* Natural Disaster 
* Theft 
* Expensive purchase of new glasses 
* Laptop repair (online studying) 
* Need to care for a sick family member

The above situations are examples; each application is considered individually by the Commission. 

**Attention!** 

The aid can be granted up to 2 times a year, however, it cannot be granted twice for the same reason (e.g., in case of a chronic disease, the situation must change, for example, by introducing a new therapy). Each circumstance indicated in the application must be thoroughly documented. 

The application can be found in USOSweb – For All - Applications. It must be submitted no later than 3 months from the date of the event that affected your living situation. Additionally, please note that it is not enough to register the application in USOSweb; it is necessary to bring a printed version to the Scholarship Coordinator. You can find your coordinator's address under the Applications tab at the top of this page.
