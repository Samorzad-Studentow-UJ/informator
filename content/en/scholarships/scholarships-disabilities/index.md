Scholarships can be awarded to students with disabilities for every student with a valid certificate confirming the degree of disability. 

A certificate confirming the degree of disability must be submitted in advance to the Department of People with Disabilities. 

DON, Collegium Paderevianum II al. Mickiewicza 9a, <https://don.uj.edu.pl/> 

The scholarship for students with disabilities is granted for the period of validity of the certificate confirming the disability, but not longer than for an academic year. In the next academic year, the application must be re-submitted. 

In case of expiration of the certificate during the academic year, the scholarship ceases to be paid as of the month following the expiration of the certificate. 

If a student reacquires a disability certificate that continuous the previous one, the student is entitled to continue receiving the grant if the student applied no later than three months after the previous certificate becomes invalid, along with a valid new certificate. 

Scholarships for students with disabilities can be granted during the academic year; application can be submitted at any time through the USOSweb site (under For All—Applications). In this situation, the scholarship is granted from the month the application was submitted, but without compensation for previous months.
