Every student in a tough financial situation has the right to receive a social scholarship. The student's financial situation is determined by monthly net earnings per student’s family member. 

Social scholarship is granted per semester- in winter semester for 5 months, in summer semester for 4 months. The social scholarship is paid every month. The deadline to submit social scholarship request, to be granted for the winter semester, is September 30th of a previous academic year to the academic year when the scholarship will be granted; for the summer semester, it is January 31 of an academic year. 

During the determination of an amount of income allowing the student to apply for a scholarship, incomes are included from: 

* Student, 
* Student’s spouse 
* Parents or guardians of the student 
* Dependent minor children, children in school up to age 26 or, if age 26 is in the last year of college, until graduation, and disabled children regardless of age. 

A student who does not run a joint household with any parent, legal guardian, or actual guardian may apply for a maintenance grant without proving the income earned by them and their dependent children if they meet **one** of the following conditions: 

* has reached the age of 26, 
* remains married, 
* has dependent children, 
* has a constant source of income and the student's average monthly income in the previous fiscal year and in the current year in the months preceding the month of submitting the statement referred to in paragraph 3 is greater than or equal to 1.15 of the sums of the amounts specified in article 5 paragraph 1 and article 6 paragraph 2 point 3 of the Family Benefits Act of 28 November 2003. 

Each circumstance indicated in the application must be documented; the current list of certifications can be found in the UJ Rector's Order No. 78 dated October 1, 2019, attachments can be found at  <https://ksztalcenie.uj.edu.pl/akty-prawne/pomoc-materialna.>
