The history of educating citizens in the associated universities dates back more than 1000 years and the current total number of students in all universities exceeds 400,000. The academic community of Una Europa reaches half a million and the number of remote learners has several million participants. The Alliance aims to create the university of the future - a truly European inter-university environment, built on the potential and strengths of its partners. At the moment, it is possible to take a "},{type:b,tag:c,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.una-europa.eu\u002Finitiatives\u002Fjoint-european-bachelor",rel:[d,e,f],target:g},children:[{type:a,value:"Bachelor's degree in European Studies"}]},{type:a,value:" as part of the university's collaboration, whereby the awarding of the final degree involves it being honoured by all partner universities.

Cultural and social diversity is a benefit that will make it easier to adapt the functioning of the alliance, as well as improve the transfer of what is most valuable - experiences beyond national borders. A programme aimed at sharing cultural experiences, social differences and also the way things work is the seven-week online course - "},{type:b,tag:c,props:{href:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.una-europa.eu\u002Finitiatives\u002Funa-together",rel:[d,e,f],target:g},children:[{type:a,value:"Una.Together"}]},{type:a,value:". It also aims to engage the international student community in academic and social networking that will broaden the perspectives and concepts of international integration. Additionally, as part of the alliance's work, an initiative is envisaged to be carried out periodically on the premises of the partner universities - the Student Congress, the honour of which for the year 2022 fell to the Jagiellonian University.
